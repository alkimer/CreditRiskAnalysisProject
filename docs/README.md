Credit risk modeling is one of the most common uses of machine learning within this industry, whose goal is to use financial data to predict default risk. When a business or individual applies for a loan, the lender must evaluate whether the company can repay the loan principal and interest reliably. The machine learning model learns from data (such as firm information, financial statements, previous transactions, previous credit history, etc) and can accurately predict repayment probability for a given business loan applicant.
